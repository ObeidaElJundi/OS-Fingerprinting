# OS-Fingerprinting
Identifying hosts OSes remotely + passively + automatically using Deep Learning

OS fingerprinting is the art of remotely identifying hosts OSes. It has several potential applications in the field of computer networks and information security. Most previous work focused on sending packets to victims and analyzing the response by searching a database of manually crafted rules. This suffers form the need of domain experts to analyze victims responses and come up with rules, which in turn consumes much time and effort. Additionally, since packets are actively sent, victims can detect and therefore modify their responses to bypass these manually crafted rules. In this work, we present a new system that is capable of passively and automatically identifying hosts OSes without the need of domain experts and the handcrafted rules. With the help of Deep Learning, the system will figure out the rules that map network traffic to its OS by itself with minimum network knowledge.
